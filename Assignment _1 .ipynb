    "Explaintion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The findErrorNums function takes an array of numbers as input and aims to find the duplicate and missing numbers within that array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of the input array is calculated and stored in the variable n. This will help in various calculations later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected sum of all the numbers in the array is calculated using a formula: n * (n + 1) / 2. This is the sum we would expect if the array had no duplicate or missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual sum of all the numbers in the array is calculated using the sum function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum is calculated and stored in the variable diff. This difference represents the difference between the missing number and the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the duplicate number, the code calculates the expected sum of squares of the array using a formula: n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6. This is the sum of the squares we would expect if the array had no duplicate or missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual sum of squares of the array is calculated using a loop that squares each number in the array and sums them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the expected sum of squares and the actual sum of squares is calculated and stored in the variable diff_of_squares. This difference represents the difference between the squares of the missing number and the duplicate number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then uses a mathematical approach to solve a system of equations. It derives two equations from the differences calculated earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "x - y = diff (where x represents the missing number and y represents the duplicate number)\n",
    "x^2 - y^2 = diff_of_squares\n",
    "By simplifying these equations and solving them simultaneously, the code derives the values of x and y:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = (diff_of_squares / diff + diff) / 2\n",
    "y = (diff_of_squares / diff - diff) / 2\n",
    "Finally, the calculated values of x and y are converted from floats to integers (since the numbers in the array are typically integers) and returned as a list containing the duplicate and missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the code calculates the difference between the expected and actual sums of the array and uses that difference to find the missing and duplicate numbers by solving a system of equations.\n",
